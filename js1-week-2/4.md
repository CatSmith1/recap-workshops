Q: What is the difference between a fork and cloned repository?

A: {YOUR ANSWER HERE}

Fork creates a copy of an original remote repository to you GitHub account, so when you make any changes, they will display in the forked repository, but not in the original one.

Cloned repository is a downloaded remote repository to the local machine.

Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
